or used as a fuel to operate a motor vehicle. A tax credit in the amount
of \$0.50 per gallon is available for the following alternative fuels:
natural gas, liquefied hydrogen, propane, P-Series fuel, liquid fuel
derived from coal through the Fischer-Tropsch process, and compressed or
liquefied gas derived from biomass. For propane and natural gas sold
after December 31, 2015, the tax credit is based on the gasoline gallon
equivalent (GGE) or diesel gallon equivalent (DGE). For taxation
purposes, one GGE is equal to 5.75 pounds (lbs.) of propane and 5.66
lbs. of compressed natural gas. One DGE is equal to 6.06 lbs. of
liquefied natural gas.

For an entity to be eligible to claim the credit they must be liable for
reporting and paying the federal excise tax on the sale or use of the
fuel in a motor vehicle. Tax exempt entities such as state and local
governments that dispense qualified fuel from an on-site fueling station
for use in vehicles qualify for the incentive. Eligible entities must be
registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The incentive must
first be taken as a credit against the entity's alternative fuel tax
liability; any excess over this fuel tax liability may be claimed as a
direct payment from the IRS. The tax credit is not allowed if an
incentive for the same alternative fuel is also determined under the
rules for the ethanol or biodiesel tax credits.

347,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for State and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, as amended, certain state
government and alternative fuel provider fleets are required to acquire
alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as a portion of their annual light-duty
vehicle acquisitions. Compliance is required by fleets that operate,
lease, or control 50 or more light-duty vehicles within the United
States. Of those 50 vehicles, at least 20 must be used primarily within
a single Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area, and those same 20 vehicles must also be capable of
being centrally fueled for the fleet to be subject to the regulatory
requirements.

Under [Standard
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/standard-compliance), the AFVs that
covered fleets acquire help them achieve compliance, with each AFV
acquired earning the fleet one AFV-acquisition credit. Covered fleets
may earn additional credits for AFVs earned in excess of their
requirements, and these credits may be banked for future use toward
compliance or traded with other fleets. Additionally, fleets that use
fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) in medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles may earn credits toward their annual AFV-acquisition
requirements. A fleet may also earn credits that may be used toward
compliance or banked once the fleet achieves compliance for investments
in alternative fuel infrastructure, mobile non-road equipment, and
emerging technologies associated with certain electric drive vehicle
technologies.

Fleets may also opt into [Alternative
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/alternative-compliance), which
allows fleets the option to choose a petroleum reduction path in lieu of
acquiring AFVs under Standard Compliance. Interested fleets must obtain
from DOE a waiver from Standard Compliance by submitting a plan that
demonstrates a path by which they will achieve a certain level of
petroleum reduction specific to their fleet composition.

357,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Federal Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, 75% of new light-duty
vehicles acquired by covered federal fleets must be alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget detailing opportunities to optimize federal fleet
performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and
compliance requirements. Specifically, the report recommends that
federal agencies identify and implement strategies to:

-   Right-size the fleet
-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

Executive Order 14008, issued in January 2021, requires the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget, in
coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the
Secretary, and the heads of other relevant agencies, to assist the
National Climate Advisor in developing a comprehensive plan to

385,US,Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Standards,"Vehicle manufacturers must meet fuel economy and GHG emissions standards
for vehicles sold in the United States. The U.S. Department of
Transportation\'s (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) regulates fuel economy standards, while the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulates GHG emissions.

NHTSA\'s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program and EPA\'s
light-duty vehicle GHG emissions program set standards for passenger
cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. By Model
Year (MY) 2025, these vehicles must meet an estimated combined average
fuel economy of 48.7 to 49.7 miles per gallon or higher. The standards
provide flexibility to manufacturers, including the ability to earn
credits for alternative fuel vehicles. For information on the standards
from MY 2017-2025, see the [final
rule](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-15/pdf/2012-21972.pdf) in
the Federal Register.

NHTSA and EPA also regulate fuel economy and GHG emissions for on-road
vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds or
greater and the engines that power them. For MY 2014-2018 medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles that are not already covered by the standards
described above, manufacturers must meet increasingly stringent fuel
economy and GHG emissions standards tailored to each of three main
regulatory subcategories: combination tractors (also known as semi
trucks); heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans; and vocational vehicles
(such as delivery, refuse, and tow trucks; transit, shuttle, and school
buses; and emergency vehicles). The standards provide flexibility,
allowing for emissions and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged,
banked, or traded. For more information, refer to the [final

390,US,Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program,"The national RFS Program was developed to increase the volume of
renewable fuel that is blended into transportation fuels. As required by
the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) finalized RFS Program regulations, effective September 1, 2007.
The [Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/laws/eisa) (EISA) increased and
expanded this standard. By 2022, 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel
must be blended into domestic transportation fuels each year. A certain
percentage of this renewable fuel must be advanced biofuel, which
includes fuels derived from approved renewable biomass, excluding corn
starch-based ethanol. Other advanced biofuels may include
sugarcane-based fuels, renewable diesel co-processed with petroleum, and
other biofuels that may exist in the future. All advanced biofuels must
achieve a minimum of a 50% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction
compared to baseline petroleum emissions. Nested within advanced
biofuels are two sub-categories: cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based
diesel, both of which have their own percentage requirements. Cellulosic
biofuel is defined as any renewable fuel derived from cellulose,
hemicellulose, or lignin that achieves a 60% GHG emissions reduction.
Biomass-based diesel is defined as a renewable transportation fuel,
transportation fuel additive, heating oil, or jet fuel, such as
biodiesel or non-ester renewable diesel, and achieves a 50% GHG
emissions reduction. If intended for use in a motor vehicle, the fuel
must also be registered with EPA as a motor vehicle fuel or fuel
additive.

Each year, EPA determines the annual percentage standards by dividing
the annual amount of renewable fuel (gallons) required by EISA for each
renewable fuel pathway by the amount of highway and non-road gasoline
and petroleum diesel estimated to be supplied that year. These
percentages are then applied to obligated parties' actual fuel sales to
determine their Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO). Any party that
produces gasoline for use in the United States, including refiners,
importers, and blenders (other than oxygenate blenders), is considered
an obligated party under the RFS Program. Parties that do not produce,
import, or market fuels within the 48 contiguous states are exempt from
the renewable fuel tracking program.

To facilitate and track compliance with the RFS, a producer or importer
of renewable fuel must generate Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)
to represent renewable fuels produced or imported by the entity on or
after September 1, 2007, assigned by gallon or batch. Assigned RINs are
transferred when ownership of a batch of fuel occurs, but not when fuel
only changes custody. A trading program is in place to allow obligated
parties to comply with their annual RVO requirements through the
purchase of RINs. Obligated parties must register with EPA in order to
participate in the trading program. For each calendar year, an obligated
party must demonstrate that it has sufficient RINs to cover its RVO.
RINs may only be used for compliance purposes in the calendar year they
are generated or the following year. Obligated parties must report their
ownership of RINs to EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality on a
quarterly and annual basis.

Vehicles Placed in Service After December 31, 2022
--------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Clean Vehicle Credit (CVC) provisions
remove manufacturer sales caps, expand the scope of eligible vehicles to
include both EVs and FCEVs, and require a traction battery that has at
least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). An available tax credit under the CVC
may be limited by the vehicle's MSRP and the buyer's modified adjusted
gross income (see below). The CVC provisions also establish criteria for
a vehicle to be considered eligible that involve sourcing requirements
for critical mineral extraction, processing, and recycling and battery
component manufacturing and assembly; these critical material and
battery component provisions begin to apply only after the U.S.
Department of the Treasury issues guidance on these particular
provisions.

Until the Treasury Department issues this critical mineral and battery
component guidance, the available CVC tax credit amounts to a base
amount of \$2500 plus, for a vehicle that draws propulsion energy from a
battery with at least 7 kWh of capacity, \$417, plus an additional \$417
for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in excess of 5 kWh. The total
tax credit available for a vehicle may not exceed \$7,500.

Once the Treasury Department issues the critical mineral and battery
component guidance, vehicles that meet the critical mineral requirements
are eligible for \$3,750 tax credit, and vehicles that meet the battery
component requirements are eligible for a \$3,750 tax credit. Vehicles
meeting both the critical mineral and the battery component requirements
are eligible for a total tax credit of \$7,500.

**Critical Minerals:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 critical minerals
portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the battery's
critical minerals that are extracted or processed in the United States
or a U.S. free-trade agreement partner or recycled in North America,
must increase according to the following schedule:

  Year                 Critical minerals minimum percent value requirement
  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  2023                 40%
  2024                 50%
  2025                 60%
  2026                 70%
  2027 and later       80%

**Battery Components:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 battery
components portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the
battery's components that are manufactured or assembled in North America
must increase according to the following schedule:

  Year                 Battery components minimum percent value requirement
  -------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  2023                 50%

  2026                 70%
  2027                 80%
  2028                 90%
  2029 and later       100%

To be eligible for the CVC tax credit, vans, sport utility vehicles, and
pickup trucks must meet the additional requirements of not having a
final manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) above \$80,000, and all
other vehicles may not have a final MSRP above \$55,000. The final MSRP
can be found on the vehicle's window sticker, which is also known as the
""Monroney label""; the final MSRP includes any trim, options, or
accessories for the particular vehicle and excludes the destination fee.

Additionally, a taxpayer's eligibility for the tax credit may be limited
by thresholds for modified adjusted gross income (MAGI); only
individuals having a MAGI below the following thresholds are eligible
for the tax credit:

-   \$300,000 for joint filers
-   \$225,000 for head-of-household filers
-   \$150,000 for single filers

Manufacturer sales caps on vehicles apply. Note that for some
manufacturers, the build location may vary based on the specific
vehicle, trim, or the date in the Model Year when it was produced
because some models are produced in multiple locations. The build
location of a particular vehicle should be confirmed by referring to its

Vehicles Purchased Before August 17, 2022
-----------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased before August 17, 2022, are eligible for a tax
credit that is available for the purchase of a new qualified EV that
draws propulsion using a traction battery that has at least five
kilowatt-hours (kWh) of capacity, uses an external source of energy to
recharge the battery, has a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,000
pounds, and meets specified emission standards. The minimum credit
amount is \$2,500, and the credit may be up to \$7,500 based on each
vehicle's traction battery capacity and the gross vehicle weight rating.
The credit will begin to be phased out for each manufacturer in the
second quarter following the calendar quarter in which a minimum of

vehicles may comply with the ZEV requirements through multiple
alternative compliance options that include producing low emission
vehicles and obtaining ZEV credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of
4,500 vehicles or less are not subject to this regulation.

CARB's emissions control program for MY 2017 through 2025 combines the
control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and requirements for
ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced Clean Cars. In
December 2012, CARB finalized new regulatory requirements that allow
vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to serve as compliance with
California's adopted GHG emissions requirements for those same model
years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018-2025 are based on a credit system
as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty
trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale in

Ethanol is defined an ethyl alcohol that has a purity of at least 99%,
exclusive of added denaturants; meets U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosives and ASTM specification D4806; and is produced
from domestic agricultural or biomass products. This requirement will

gallon of Louisiana-manufactured ethanol, less any federal tax
incentives or credits, is equal to or below the average wholesale price
of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in Louisiana for a period of
not less than 60 days, as determined by the Louisiana Department of
Agriculture and Forestry (Department).

Within six months following the point at which monthly production of
biodiesel produced in the state equals or exceeds a minimum annualized
production volume of 10 million gallons, at least 2% of the total diesel
sold by volume in the state must be biodiesel produced from domestically
grown feedstock. Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of
long chain fatty acids derived from renewable resources and meeting the
requirements of ASTM specification D6751, or a diesel fuel substitute
produced from non-petroleum renewable resources such as vegetable oils
and animal fats that meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel and
fuel additive requirements.

Alternatively, these requirements may be met through the production of
an alternate renewable fuel, defined as a liquid fuel that is
domestically produced from renewable biomass, can be used in place of
ethanol or biodiesel, and meets the definition of renewable fuel in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005. Within six months following the point at
which cumulative monthly production of an alternate renewable fuel
produced in the state equals or exceeds a minimum annual production
volume of 20 million gallons, at least 2% of the total motor fuel sold
by volume in the state must be the alternate renewable fuel produced
from domestically grown feedstock. This requirement may not exceed 2% of
the total motor fuel sold by volume by owners or operators of fuel
distribution terminals.

Blenders and retailers will have six months to meet the new minimum
ethanol, biodiesel, or alternate renewable fuel content requirements,
unless the Louisiana Commission of Weights and Measures determines that
the quality or supply of ethanol or biodiesel in the state is
insufficient or fuel distributors are unable to blend ethanol due to
delays in obtaining permits or constructing ethanol blending or storage
equipment. Any combination of alternative fuels, including but not
limited to denatured ethanol, biodiesel, and alternative renewable fuel
may be used to meet these requirements. Fuels containing ethanol or
biodiesel will not be required to be sold in ozone nonattainment areas.
The Department will adopt rules and regulations requiring incentives to
compensate for any costs associated with achieving the minimum ethanol
and biodiesel standards. The Department defines domestically grown
feedstock to include any feedstock produced in the United States.
Because in-state volume requirements are currently being met through the

HEVs and AFVs must be acquired at a rate of at least 5% annually for all
new motor vehicle purchases so that not less than 50% of the motor
vehicles the Commonwealth owns and operates will be HEVs or AFVs by
2018.

State fleets must also acquire AFVs according to the requirements of the
Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992 and the Massachusetts Office of
Vehicle Management (OVM) must approve any light-duty vehicle
acquisition. All agencies must purchase the most economical,
fuel-efficient, and low emission vehicles appropriate to their mission.

emissions standards and encourage the purchase or lease of
fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). Specifically, DGS
must reduce or displace the fleet's consumption of petroleum products by
20% by January 1, 2020, as compared to the 2003 consumption level.
Beginning in fiscal year 2024, DGS must also ensure that at least 50% of
the light-duty vehicles purchased by the state are zero emission
vehicles (ZEVs). Further, at least 15% of DGS' fleet of new vehicles
with a gross vehicle weight rating of 19,000 pounds or more must be ZEVs
by 2025, and at least 30% by 2030.

On an annual basis, DGS must compile information including, but not
limited to, the number of AFVs and hybrid electric vehicles acquired,
the locations of the alternative fuel pumps available for those
vehicles, and the total amount of alternative fuels used. Vehicles the
state owns or leases that are capable of operating on alternative fuel
must operate on that fuel unless the alternative fuel is not available.
DGS is also required to:

-   Take steps to transfer vehicles between agencies and departments to
    ensure that the most fuel-efficient vehicles are used and to
    eliminate the least fuel-efficient vehicles from the state's motor
    vehicle fleet;

LEV II standards represent the maximum exhaust emissions for LEVs, Ultra
LEVs, and Super Ultra LEVs, including flexible fuel, bi-fuel, and
dual-fuel vehicles when operating on an alternative fuel. MY 2009 and
subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles must meet specified fleet average greenhouse gas
(GHG) exhaust emissions requirements. Each manufacturer must comply with
these fleet average GHG requirements, which are based on California Air
Resources Board (CARB) calculations. Bi-fuel, flexible fuel, dual-fuel,
and grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles may be eligible for an
alternative compliance method.

In December 2012, CARB finalized regulatory requirements, referred to as
LEV III, which allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to
serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG emissions requirements
for those same model years.

In August 2022, CARB approved LEV IV standards, which updates
regulations for light- and medium-duty internal combustion engine
vehicles by reducing allowable exhaust emissions and emissions caused by
evaporation. LEV IV also changes the calculation procedure for new
vehicle fleet-average emissions and prohibits zero emissions vehicles
from being considered in fleet-average emissions calculations by MY
2029.

-   By 2030, there will be 5 million ZEVs on the road in California; and
-   By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
    will be 80% less than 1990 levels.

State agencies must also work with their stakeholders to accomplish the
following:

-   Develop new criteria for clean vehicle incentive programs to
    encourage manufacturers to produce clean, affordable cars;
-   Update the 2016 ZEV Action plan, with a focus on low income and
    disadvantaged communities;

11167,CA,Hydrogen Fueling Station Evaluation,"The California Air Resources Board (CARB) may not enforce any element of
regulations that would require a supplier to construct, operate, or
provide funding to construct or operate a publicly available hydrogen
fueling station.

Annually, CARB must aggregate and share the number of hydrogen vehicles
that manufacturers project will be sold or leased over the next three
years and the total number of hydrogen vehicle registered in the state.
Based on this information, CARB must evaluate the need for additional
publicly available hydrogen fueling stations for the subsequent three
years and report findings to the California Energy Commission (CEC)
including the of number of stations, geographic areas where stations are
needed, and minimum operating standards, such as number of dispensers
and filling pressures.

The CEC will allocate up to \$20 million per year to fund the number of
stations deemed necessary based on CARB's evaluation and reports. The
CEC may stop funding new stations if it determines, in consultation with
CARB, that the private sector is developing publicly available stations
without the need for government support.

The CEC and CARB must issue an annual report on progress toward
establishing a hydrogen fueling station network that meets the needs of
vehicles being used in the state. The review will determine the
remaining cost and time required to establish a network of 100 publicly
available hydrogen fueling stations and whether funding from the Clean
Transportation Program is necessary to achieve this goal. For more
